         <h2 id="h227">Types of Safety Hazards</h2>

         <p id="p94">There are some very serious safety risks in scientific research. When studying a science like chemistry, scientists need to make sure that they do not mix two explosive chemicals together. Since the life sciences deal with living organisms, some research may have risks not found in other fields. Safety practices must be followed when working with the following hazardous things:</p>

         <ul id="ul22" epub:type="list"><li id="li101">Disease-causing viruses, bacteria or fungi</li>
    
            <li id="li102">Parasites</li>
    
            <li id="li103">Wild animals</li>
    
            <li id="li104">Radioactive materials</li>
    
            <li id="li105">Pollutants in air, water, or soil</li>
    
            <li id="li106">Toxins</li>
    
            <li id="li107">Teratogens</li>
    
            <li id="li108">Carcinogens</li>
    
            <li id="li109">Radiation</li>

         </ul><p id="p95">The kinds of risks that scientists face depend on the kind of research they perform. For example, a bacteriologist working with bacteria in a laboratory faces different risks than a zoologist studying the behavior of lions in Africa.</p>

         <p id="p96">Think back to the deformed frogs discussed earlier. If there is something in the frogs' environment causing these deformities, could there be a risk to a researcher in that environment? A chemical in the pond that could cause such deformities is called a <span class="ref-popup-rw" data-popup-target="teratogen">teratogen</span>. If the chemical is causing deformities in frogs, could it cause deformities in humans? A scientist would most likely wear gloves and maybe even a mask when dealing with polluted water.
         </p>

         <p id="p97">Or perhaps a disease is causing the deformities. Viruses and bacteria are called <span class="ref-popup-rw" data-popup-target="biohazard">biohazards</span>. (<i>Figure <span class="ref-figure-rw">5-1</span></i>) shows laboratory safety and chemical hazard signs. Biohazards include any biological material that could make someone sick. A used needle or laboratory bacteria are also biohazards.

         <h2 id="h228">Laboratory Safety</h2>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p99">If you perform an experiment in your classroom, your teacher will explain how to be safe. Professional scientists follow safety rules as well, especially for the study of dangerous organisms like the bacteria that cause bubonic plague, as shown in (<i>Figure <span class="ref-figure-rw">5-2</span></i>) .
         </p>

         <p id="p100">Sharp objects, chemicals, heat, and electricity are all used at times in laboratories. Below is a list of safety guidelines that you should follow when doing labs:</p>

         <ul id="ul23" epub:type="list"><li id="li110">Be sure to obey all safety guidelines given in lab instructions and your teacher.</li>
    
            <li id="li111">Follow directions carefully.</li>
    
            <li id="li112">Tie back long hair.</li>
    
            <li id="li113">Wear closed shoes with flat heels and shirts with no hanging sleeves, hoods, or drawstrings.</li>
    
            <li id="li114">Use gloves, goggles, or safety aprons when instructed to do so.</li>
    
            <li id="li115">Broken glass should only be cleaned up with a dust pan and broom. Never touch broken glass with your bare hands.</li>
    
            <li id="li116">Never eat or drink anything in the science lab. Table tops and counters could have dangerous substances on them.</li>
    
            <li id="li117">Be sure to completely clean materials like test tubes and beakers. Leftover substances could interact with other substances in future experiments.</li>
    
            <li id="li118">If you are using flames or heat plates, be careful when you reach. Be sure your arms and hair are kept far away from heat.</li>
    
            <li id="li119">Alert your teacher immediately if anything out of the ordinary occurs. An accident report may be required if someone is hurt and the lab supervisor must know if any materials are damaged or discarded.</li>

         <h2 id="h229">Field Research Safety</h2>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p102">Scientists who work outdoors, called <span class="ref-popup-rw" data-popup-target="field_scientist">field scientists</span>, are also required to follow safety regulations designed to prevent harm to themselves, other humans, to animals, and the environment. In fact, if scientists work outside the country, they are required to learn about and follow the laws and restrictions of the country in which they are doing research. For example, entomologists following monarch butterfly (<i>Figure <span class="ref-figure-rw">5-3</span></i>) migrations between the United States and Mexico must follow regulations in both countries.

         </div>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p104">Field scientists are also required to follow laws to protect the environment. Before biologists can study protected wildlife or plant species, they must apply for permission to do so, and obtain a research permit. For example, if scientists collect butterflies without a permit, they may unknowingly disturb the balance of the organism's habitat.</p>

         <h2 id="h230">Lesson Summary</h2>

         <ul id="ul24" epub:type="list"><li id="li120">Research of any kind may have safety risks. Because life scientists study organisms as diverse as bacteria and bears, they deal with risks that other scientists may never encounter.</li>
    
            <li id="li121">The risks scientists face depend on the kind of research they are doing.</li>
    
            <li id="li122">Scientists are required by federal, state, and local institutions to follow strict regulations designed to protect the safety of themselves, the public, and the environment.</li>
