         <h2 id="h211">The Scientific Method</h2>

         <p id="p38">The <span class="ref-popup-rw" data-popup-target="scientific_method">scientific method</span> is a process used to investigate the unknown. This process uses evidence and testing. Scientists use the scientific method so they can find information. A common method allows all scientists to answer questions in a similar way. Scientists who use this method can reproduce another scientist's experiments. Why do you think it is important that scientists reproduce each other's experiments?
         </p>

         <p id="p39">Almost all versions of the scientific method include the following steps, though not always in the same order:</p>

         </ol><h3 id="h33">Making Observations</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p40">Imagine that you are scientist. While collecting water samples at a local pond, you notice a frog with five legs instead of four (<em>Figure <span class="ref-figure-rw">3-1</span></em>). As you start to look around, you discover that many of the frogs have extra limbs, extra eyes or no eyes. One frog even has limbs coming out of its mouth. These are your <strong> observations </strong> , or things you notice about an environment using your five senses.
         </p>

         </div>

         <h3 id="h34">Identify a Question Based on Your Observations</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p42">The next step is to ask a question about the frogs. You may ask, "Why are so many frogs are deformed?" Or, "Is there something in their environment causing these defects, like water pollution?"</p>

         <p id="p43">Yet, you do not know if this large number of deformities is "normal" for frogs. What if many of the frogs found in ponds and lakes all over the world have similar deformities? Before you look for causes, you need to find out if the number and kind of deformities is unusual. So besides finding out <em> why </em> the frogs are deformed, you should also ask: "Is the percentage of deformed frogs in this pond greater than the percentage of deformed frogs in other places?" (<em>Figure <span class="ref-figure-rw">3-2</span></em>)
         </p>

         <h3 id="h35">Research Existing Knowledge About the Topic</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p45">No matter what you observe, you need to find out what is already known about your questions. For example, is anyone else doing research on deformed frogs? If yes, what did they find out? Do you think that you should repeat their research to see if it can be duplicated? During your research, you might learn something that convinces you to change or refine your question.</p>

         <h3 id="h36">Construct a Hypothesis</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p46">A <span class="ref-popup-rw" data-popup-target="hypothesis">hypothesis</span> is an educated guess that tries to explain an observation. A good hypothesis allows you to make more predictions. For example, you might hypothesize that a pesticide from a nearby farm is running into the pond and causing frogs to have extra legs. If that's true, then you can predict that the water in a pond of non-deformed frogs will have lower levels of that pesticide.
         </p>

         <p id="p47">That's a prediction you can test by measuring pesticide levels in two sets of ponds, those with deformed frogs and those with nothing but healthy frogs. Every hypothesis needs to be written in a way that it can:</p>

         <ol class="x-ck12-decimal" id="x-ck12-decimal6" epub:type="list"><li id="li62">Be tested using evidence.</li>
    
            <li id="li63">Be proven wrong.</li>
    
            <li id="li64">Provide measurable results.</li>
    
            <li id="li65">Provide yes or no answers.</li>

         </ol><p id="p48">For example, do you think the following hypothesis meets the four criteria above? Let's see. Hypothesis: "The number of deformed frogs in five ponds that are polluted with chemical X is higher than the number of deformed frogs in five ponds without chemical X."</p>

         <h3 id="h37">Test Your Hypothesis</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p49">To test the hypothesis, you would count the healthy and deformed frogs and measure the amount of chemical X in all of the ponds. The hypothesis will be either true or false. Here is an example of a hypothesis that is not testable: "The frogs are deformed because someone cast a magic spell on them." You cannot test a magic hypothesis or measure any results of magic. Doing an experiment will test most hypotheses. The experiment may generate evidence in support of the hypothesis. The experiment may also generate evidence proving the hypothesis false.</p>

         <h3 id="h38">Analyze Data and Draw a Conclusion</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p50">If a hypothesis and experiment are well-designed, the experiment will produce results that you can measure, collect, and analyze. The <strong> analysis </strong> should tell you if the hypothesis is true or false. See <em>Table <span class="ref-table-rw">3-1</span></em> for the experimental results.

         </p>

         <p id="p52">Your results show that pesticide levels in the two sets of ponds are different, but the average number of deformed frogs is almost the same. Your results demonstrate that your hypothesis is false. The situation may be more complicated than you thought. This gives you new information that will help you decide what to do next. Even if the results supported your hypothesis, you would probably ask a new question to try to better understand what is happening to the frogs and why.</p>

         <h3 id="h39">Drawing Conclusions and Communicating Results</h3>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p53">If a hypothesis and experiment are well-designed, the results will tell whether your hypothesis is true or false. If a hypothesis is true, scientists will often continuing testing the hypothesis in new ways to learn more. If a hypothesis is false, the results may be used to come up with and test a new hypothesis.</p>

         <p id="p54">Scientists communicate their results in a number of ways. For example, they may talk to small groups of scientists and give talks at large scientific meetings. They will write articles for scientific journals. Their findings may also be communicated to journalists.</p>

         <p id="p55">If you conclude that frogs are deformed due to a pesticide not previously measured, you would publish an article and give talks about your research. Your conclusion could eventually help find solutions to this problem.</p>

         <h2 id="h212">Basic and Applied Science</h2>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p56">Science can be "basic" or "applied." The goal of <span class="ref-popup-rw" data-popup-target="basic_science">basic science</span> is to understand how things work - whether it is a cell or a whole ecosystem. Basic science is the source of most scientific theories and new knowledge. For example, a scientist that tries to find the right drug to treat brain injuries is performing basic science.
         </p>

         <p id="p57"><span class="ref-popup-rw" data-popup-target="applied_science">Applied science</span> is using scientific discoveries to solve practical problems. Applied science also creates new technologies. For example, medicine and all that is known about how to treat patients is applied science based on basic research (<em>Figure <span class="ref-figure-rw">3-3</span></em>). A doctor administering a drug or performing surgery on a patient is an example of applied science.
